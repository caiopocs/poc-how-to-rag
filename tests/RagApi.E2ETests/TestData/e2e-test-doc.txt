E2E Testing for RAG Systems

End-to-end testing is crucial for validating the complete workflow of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.

Test Coverage

E2E tests should verify:
1. Document upload and ingestion
2. Query processing and response generation
3. Source citation accuracy
4. Error handling and edge cases

Benefits of E2E Testing

E2E tests provide confidence that all components work together correctly:
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Documents are processed and stored
- Queries return accurate results
- The entire pipeline is functional

Testing Best Practices

When testing RAG systems:
- Use realistic test data
- Verify both responses and sources
- Test error scenarios
- Monitor performance metrics
- Validate semantic accuracy

This document will be used for E2E testing scenarios.
